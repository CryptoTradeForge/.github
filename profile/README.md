# 🔥 CryptoTradeForge

Welcome to **[CryptoTradeForge](https://github.com/CryptoTradeForge)** — a development hub for crypto trading automation, built by [Rui0828](https://github.com/Rui0828) and [yumeow0122](https://github.com/yumeow0122).

This is where we write, organize, and maintain a growing collection of tools and frameworks for algorithmic trading. Not just a code archive — it’s our sandbox for building smarter systems and experimenting with ideas that (sometimes) work.

⚙️ **Focus Areas**  
- ♻️ Modular and reusable code  
- 🧪 Backtesting and live trading support  
- 📈 Infrastructure that scales  
- 📚 Clean code and documentation (we try our best)  

🏦 **Exchange Target**  
- Binance-first, but designed to be portable

## 📦 What’s inside?

We build, test, and sometimes break things — all in the name of better trading tech.  
Feel free to explore. The forge never sleeps. 🧨
