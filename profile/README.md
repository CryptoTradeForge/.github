# CryptoTradeForge

Welcome to **[CryptoTradeForge](https://github.com/CryptoTradeForge)** — a development hub for crypto trading automation, built by [Rui0828](https://github.com/Rui0828) and [yumeow0122](https://github.com/yumeow0122).

This organization is where we write, organize, and maintain a growing set of trading tools and frameworks. It's not just a code dump — it's our sandbox for building smarter systems and improving how we trade.

We're focused on:
- Writing reusable and modular code
- Building systems that support both backtesting and live trading
- Managing infrastructure that actually scales
- Keeping things clean, readable, and documented (most of the time)

Our main playground is **Binance**, but the designs are flexible enough for other exchanges or future expansion.

## What's in here?

- Frameworks for automating crypto trades  
- Utilities to support strategy development and testing  
- Custom features we found useful (or just couldn't find elsewhere)  

## What this is not:

- Not a signal group  
- Not a black box money printer  
- Not financial advice  

---

We're here to build, learn, and occasionally refactor things that used to work.  
Feel free to explore — the forge is always running.
